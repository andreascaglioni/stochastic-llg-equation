## Installation
1. Clone the repo:
   ```sh
   git clone <git@github.com:andreascaglioni/stochastic-llg-equation.git>
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   - The finite elements computations are run with dolfin-x, the Python interface to Fenics-x. See their website for installation instructions (Conda environment *recommended*):
   [https://fenicsproject.org/download/](https://fenicsproject.org/download/) 
   
   - Running the code requires several basic Python dependencies:
      ```sh
         pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```
      
3. Optionally, you can install ParaView to visualize the solutions from the examples stored in .xdmf files. Find more instructions on their website:
   [https://www.paraview.org/](https://www.paraview.org/)

## Usage
Run the examples from the root directory of the project with
```sh
python3 examples/example_<name>.py
```

## Features
- Implementation of the Tangent Plane Scheme (TPS) as in the publication:

   Akrivis G., Feischl M., Kovács B. and Lubich C.; (2021).  Higher-order linearly implicit full discretization of the Landau–Lifshitz–Gilbert equation. *Math. Comp.*, *90*, 995-1038. [DOI: 10.1090/mcom/3597](https://doi.org/10.1090/mcom/3597)

   In particular, the tangent plane constraint is implemented in a ``weak'' L2 sense and
both the BDF time stepping and finite elements space discretizations are high-order.

- Lévy-Ciesielski parametrization of the Brownian motion: Given n i.i.d. samples of the standard normal distribution, generate a sample path in time.

- Structured, modular implementation of the Tangent Plane Scheme, split into sub-functions as well as several supporting functions such as 
computation of the error, 
computation of the inf-sup constant, 
exporting solutions to .XDMF files.

- Examples and documentation: Several examples illustrate the use of the library, including good practices e.g. defining the data a separate file, commenting the code. Functions, especially in src/, are thoroughly documented (Google style).

- Future additions: 
   - [ ] Unit testing with Pytest, 
   - [ ] A documentation page, 
   - [ ] High order version of the TPS,
   - [ ] More examples (external magnetic field, hysteresis, Skyrmions, ...),
   - [ ] Autormated Testing with *GitHub Actions*
