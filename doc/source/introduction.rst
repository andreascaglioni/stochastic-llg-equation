Introduction
============
Approximation of the sample paths of the *Stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation* from dynamic micromagnetics.

Installation & Usage
--------------------
For the moment, only the repository is available. In the future a package will
be released on PyPI.

#. Clone the repository:

.. code-block:: console
    
    git clone <git@github.com:andreascaglioni/stochastic-llg-equation.git>
    
#. Install dependencies:

   * The finite elements computations are run with dolfin-x, the Python interface to Fenics-x. See their website `fenicsproject.org <https://fenicsproject.org/>`_ for installation instructions (Conda environment *recommended*).
   
   * Running the code requires several basic Python dependencies:
      
  .. code-block:: console
    
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
#. Optionally, you can install ParaView to visualize the solutions from the examples stored in .xdmf files. Find more instructions on their website: `paraview.org <https://www.paraview.org/>`_.

Usage
-----
Run the examples from the root directory of the project with

.. code-block:: python
   
   python3 examples/example_<name>.py

Features
--------

* Implementation of the Tangent Plane Scheme (TPS) as in the publication :cite:`Akrivis2021Higher`. Here, the tangent plane constraint is understood in a "weak" L2 sense and both the BDF time stepping and finite elements space discretizations are high-order.
* LÃ©vy-Ciesielski parametrization of the Brownian motion: Given n i.i.d. samples of the standard normal distribution, generate a sample path in time.
* Structured, modular implementation of the Tangent Plane Scheme, split into sub-functions as well as several supporting functions such as:
  
  * Computation of the error;

  * Computation of the inf-sup constant;

  * Exporting solutions to .XDMF files.

* Examples and documentation: Several examples illustrate the use of the library, including good practices e.g. defining the data a separate file, commenting the code. Functions, especially in src/, are thoroughly documented (Google style).

Future to be added in the future: 

* Unit testing with Pytest
* High order version of the TPS
* More examples (external magnetic field, hysteresis, Skyrmions, ...)
* Automated Testing with *GitHub Actions*
