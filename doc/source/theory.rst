Theory of the Stochastic LLG Equation
=====================================

Basic explenations on the stochastic LLG equation and the Tanget Plane Schemen 
are coming soon!

The scheme we implemented for time and sapce integration was in large part defined in the publication:
:cite:`Akrivis2021Higher`

This scheme offers a first valid high-ordermethod for the LLG equation. This was 
not possible in the paper on the original tangent plane sceme:
:cite:`alouges2008new`.

The work done by the author with this code led to the following publications:

* A preprint (soon to be published) on the approximation of the 
  Stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with a-priori determined sparse 
  grid and rates of convergence: 
  :cite:`an2024sparse`;

* The PhD thesis, which comprises the previous two 
  papers, some theoretical extensions, and more comments on SGMethods:
  :cite:`scaglioni2024sparse`.
